# UI Library Template - Active Context

## Project Overview
This is a monorepo UI component library template built with:
- Yarn 4 workspaces for monorepo management
- React 19.1.0 with TypeScript 5.8.3
- Tailwind CSS v4.1.11 (alpha) with shadcn/ui design system
- Vite 7.0.4 for building
- Storybook 9.0.17 for component development
- Next.js 15.4.1 with Nextra for documentation

## Current State Analysis (Updated)

### 1. ✅ COMPLETED - Tailwind CSS v4 Migration
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Successfully migrated to stable v4.0 (released Jan 22, 2025)
- **UI Package**: Updated to use `@import "tailwindcss"` and `@theme` directive
- **Custom Button**: Added CSS with custom animations and Tailwind v4 imports
- **Storybook**: Configured to use Tailwind v4 with proper imports
- **Config Files**: Removed unnecessary tailwind.config.js files (not needed in v4)
- **PostCSS**: Updated for v4 compatibility, removed unused root config

### 2. ✅ COMPLETED - Dependency Issues Resolution
- **Storybook**: Successfully standardized all packages to v9.0.17
- **DevDependencies**: Cleaned up root package.json (25 → 9 essential packages)
- **TypeScript**: Standardized version syntax to ^5.8.3 across all packages
- **Yarn**: Fixed version consistency (yarn@4.9.2) across all workspaces
- **Peer Dependencies**: Resolved React dependency warnings in monorepo

### 3. ✅ COMPLETED - Package Configuration Issues
- **Package Exports**: Complete exports fields with ESM/CJS support for all packages
- **Build Configs**: Proper external dependencies and dual format builds
- **CSS Integration**: Fixed CSS imports and asset naming
- **Tree-shaking**: Optimized subpath exports for better bundling

### 4. Missing Production Features
- **Testing**: No test setup, frameworks, or test files
- **CI/CD**: No GitHub Actions or automated pipelines
- **Publishing**: No npm publish configuration or scripts
- **Documentation**: Missing CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Quality**: No pre-commit hooks, code coverage, or bundle size tracking
- **Versioning**: No automated version management (changesets)

### 4. Current Package Structure
- `@smilexx2/ui-core`: Core utilities (cn function)
- `@smilexx2/ui`: Main UI components (Button with shadcn/ui patterns)
- `@smilexx2/custom-button`: Extended button with animations and effects
- `docs`: Next.js documentation site with Nextra
- `storybook`: Component development environment
