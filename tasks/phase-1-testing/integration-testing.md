# Integration Testing

## Overview
Set up comprehensive integration testing including Storybook interaction tests, accessibility testing, and visual regression testing.

## Phase
Phase 1: Testing Infrastructure

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
- Unit Testing Setup

## Description
Implement integration testing to ensure components work correctly together and meet accessibility standards. Include visual regression testing to catch UI changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Storybook interaction tests configured
- [ ] Accessibility testing with @axe-core/react implemented
- [ ] Visual regression testing set up
- [ ] E2E tests for documentation site created
- [ ] All tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Storybook Interaction Tests
```bash
yarn add -D @storybook/test-runner @storybook/addon-interactions
```
- Configure test-runner for Storybook
- Add interaction tests to existing stories
- Set up assertions for user interactions

### 2. Accessibility Testing
```bash
yarn add -D @axe-core/react @storybook/addon-a11y
```
- Configure axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- Add accessibility checks to Storybook
- Create accessibility test cases for all components

### 3. Visual Regression Testing
Choose and implement one of:
- Chromatic (recommended for Storybook)
- Percy
- Playwright visual comparisons

### 4. E2E Documentation Tests
```bash
yarn add -D @playwright/test
```
- Test documentation site navigation
- Verify component examples work correctly
- Test responsive behavior

### 5. CI Integration
- Configure tests to run on pull requests
- Set up parallel test execution
- Add test result reporting

## Files to Create/Modify
- `.storybook/test-runner.js`
- `packages/*/src/**/*.stories.ts` (add interaction tests)
- `playwright.config.ts`
- `e2e/` directory with test files
- `.github/workflows/` test configurations

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Notes
- Consider budget for visual testing services
- Ensure tests are stable and not flaky
- Document testing best practices for team
