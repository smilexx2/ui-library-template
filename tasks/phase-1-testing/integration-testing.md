# Integration Testing

## Overview
Set up comprehensive integration testing that builds upon the unit testing foundation, focusing on component interactions, accessibility, and real-world usage scenarios.

## Phase
Phase 1: Testing Infrastructure

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
- Unit Testing Setup (must be completed first)

## Description
Implement integration testing to ensure components work correctly together and meet accessibility standards. This extends the 4-phase testing plan with advanced testing capabilities for component interactions and user workflows.

## Integration with Unit Testing Plan

This task complements the **Phase 4: Storybook Integration** from the unit testing setup, adding comprehensive interaction and accessibility testing capabilities.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Enhanced Storybook Integration (builds on Phase 4)

#### Interaction Tests with Existing Addon
- Leverage the already configured @storybook/addon-vitest for story-based testing
- Create interaction stories that test user workflows (click, hover, focus)
- Add variant interaction stories that test all button variants functionality
- Implement keyboard navigation testing within stories

#### Custom Button Integration Tests
- Create enhanced feature stories for CustomButton with animation testing
- Test hover and click interactions specific to enhanced components
- Verify custom functionality works correctly in isolation

### 2. Accessibility Testing Integration

#### Configure Accessibility Testing
- Install @axe-core/react and @storybook/addon-a11y
- Update Storybook main.ts to include accessibility addon
- Configure accessibility rules for color contrast and keyboard navigation

#### Accessibility Test Cases
- Create dedicated accessibility stories for all components
- Test proper ARIA labels and button accessibility
- Implement keyboard navigation stories with Tab and Enter testing
- Ensure disabled states are properly handled and announced

### 3. Component Integration Testing

#### Cross-Package Integration
- Test cn utility integration with Button components
- Verify component composition patterns work correctly
- Test className merging and precedence across packages
- Ensure consistent styling when components are used together

#### Theme Integration Testing
- Test consistent theming across all components
- Verify CSS variable usage is consistent between packages
- Test component styling in various theme contexts
- Ensure color and spacing tokens are applied uniformly

### 4. E2E Documentation Tests

#### Install Playwright
- Add Playwright for end-to-end testing of live applications
- Configure multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Set up test environment with proper wait strategies

#### Documentation Site E2E Tests
- Test documentation site navigation and component examples
- Verify responsive behavior across different viewports
- Test component examples render and function correctly
- Ensure documentation links and interactions work properly

#### Storybook E2E Tests
- Test Storybook component story rendering
- Verify interaction tests pass in the Storybook environment
- Test story navigation and addon functionality
- Ensure interactions panel shows correct test results

### 5. Test Configuration Files

#### Playwright Configuration
- Configure test directory, browser projects, and retry strategies
- Set up web servers for documentation site and Storybook
- Configure proper base URLs and trace collection
- Set up parallel execution and CI-specific settings

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Storybook interaction tests configured for all components
- [ ] Accessibility testing integrated with @storybook/addon-a11y
- [ ] Cross-package integration tests written
- [ ] Theme consistency tests implemented
- [ ] E2E tests for documentation site created
- [ ] E2E tests for Storybook functionality created
- [ ] All tests integrated with existing unit testing infrastructure
- [ ] Default stories replaced with real component interactions

## Files to Create/Modify
- `storybook/src/stories/*-interactions.stories.tsx` (interaction tests)
- `storybook/src/stories/accessibility.stories.tsx`
- `packages/*/src/**/*.integration.test.tsx`
- `test-utils/theme-integration.test.tsx`
- `e2e/` directory with Playwright tests
- `playwright.config.ts`
- Update `.storybook/main.ts` for accessibility addon
- Update package.json scripts for E2E testing

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days (after unit testing setup is complete)

## Notes
- Build on the unit testing foundation - don't duplicate effort
- Focus on component interactions and user workflows
- Ensure accessibility testing covers keyboard navigation and screen readers
- E2E tests should verify the actual user experience
- Integrate with existing Storybook setup rather than replacing it
- Document testing patterns for future component development
