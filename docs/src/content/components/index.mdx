# Components

Welcome to the components section! This library is currently being built from scratch.

## Coming Soon

Components will be added here as they are developed. Each component will include:

- **Live Examples** - Interactive demos showing the component in action
- **API Documentation** - Complete prop definitions and usage examples
- **Accessibility Guidelines** - Best practices for keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Styling Information** - How to customize and theme the component

## Component Development

When components are added, they will follow these principles:

- **Accessibility First** - All components will be keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly
- **TypeScript Native** - Full type safety with comprehensive prop definitions
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- **Theme Support** - Customizable styling with Tailwind CSS
- **Modern React** - Using React hooks and modern patterns

Stay tuned for new components!
