    "./node_modules/@smilexx2/ui-library/dist/**/*.js"
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can import and use components in your React application:

```tsx
import { /* Components will be added here */ } from '@smilexx2/ui-library'

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Components will be used here */}
    </div>
  )
}
```
