# UI Library Documentation

Welcome to the UI Library documentation! This library is currently being built from scratch.

## Getting Started

This component library is built with:
- **React** - For creating reusable UI components
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling and responsive design
- **Rollup** - For bundling and optimization

## Installation

```bash
npm install @smilexx2/ui-library
```

## Usage

Components will be added here as they are developed. Stay tuned!

```tsx
import { /* Components will be added here */ } from '@smilexx2/ui-library'
```

## Development

The library is currently empty and ready for new components to be added. Each component will be:
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Accessible and keyboard navigable
- Responsive and mobile-friendly
- Themeable with Tailwind CSS
- Well documented with examples
